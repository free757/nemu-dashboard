════════════════════════════════════════════
UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (apply to ANY video scenario)
════════════════════════════════════════════

PRINCIPLE 1 — ONE HAND = ONE ACTION (Critical)
  A single hand performing one continuous motion = ONE label item, NEVER two.
  ❌ WRONG: "hold ladle with right hand, stir soup with ladle in right hand" (SAME right hand twice!)
  ✅ RIGHT: "stir soup with ladle in right hand"
  Rule: The action verb (stir, dig, wipe, cut...) already implies the hand is holding the tool.
  Do NOT add "hold [tool] with [hand]" when that same hand is already using the tool.

PRINCIPLE 2 — OFF-HAND CLAUSE (When to label the other hand)
  ONLY label the non-primary hand IF it is actively doing something task-relevant.
  ✅ Label when: holding the primary object being worked on (e.g., holding a carrot while the other cuts)
  ✅ Label when: passing an object, steadying a surface, or performing its own distinct action
  ❌ Do NOT label when: the hand is idle, resting, or not touching any task object
  ❌ Do NOT label when: the hand holds a passive container sitting on a surface

  EXAMPLES:
  ✅ "hold carrot with left hand, cut carrot with right hand"
  ✅ "hold cloth in left hand, smoothen cloth with right hand"
  ✅ "hold glass cup with left hand, wipe glass cup with cloth in right hand"
  ❌ "hold bucket with left hand, dig soil with hoe in right hand" (if bucket is on the ground = left is idle)

PRINCIPLE 3 — OBJECT CONSISTENCY WITHIN A LABEL
  Use the EXACT SAME noun for the same object in every action within one label.
  ❌ WRONG: "hold book with left hand, wipe page with cloth in right hand" (book ≠ page)
  ✅ RIGHT: "hold book with left hand, wipe book with cloth in right hand"
  ❌ WRONG: "hold carrot with left hand, cut vegetable with right hand"
  ✅ RIGHT: "hold carrot with left hand, cut carrot with right hand"

PRINCIPLE 4 — INCLUDE LOCATION WHEN VISIBLE
  Always state where an object is placed or used, if visible in the video.
  ✅ "place cup on table with right hand" — NOT "place cup with right hand"
  ✅ "stir meat in wok with ladle in right hand" — NOT "stir meat with ladle in right hand"
  ✅ "place hoe on ground with right hand" — NOT "place hoe with right hand"

PRINCIPLE 5 — SPECIFIC TOOL AND OBJECT NAMES
  Never use vague/generic names. Always identify the exact tool or object.
  ❌ "use tool with right hand" → ✅ "dig soil with hoe in right hand"
  ❌ "pick up utensil with right hand" → ✅ "pick up ladle with right hand"
  Specific names: hoe, ladle, sewing needle, shears, pliers, screwdriver, cloth, etc.

PRINCIPLE 6 — ADJECTIVE ONLY FOR DISAMBIGUATION
  Use color/descriptor ONLY when multiple similar objects exist in the clip.
  ✅ Two cloths: "pick up red cloth with left hand" vs "pick up green cloth with right hand"
  ❌ Only one cloth: just "pick up cloth with right hand" (no color needed)
  Drop adjective once the object is uniquely identifiable.

PRINCIPLE 7 — VERB SELECTION PRECISION & BANNED WORDS
  • smoothen (NOT smooth) — for flattening/pressing cloth or fabric
  • flatten (NOT adjust/level) — for making flat objects/materials planar
  • pick up (NOT grab/reach) — for lifting or taking objects
  • place (NOT put/set) — for putting objects down (always include destination surface if visible)
  • hold (NOT grip/clutch) — for holding or steadying an object
  • slide (NOT adjust/drag/move) — for moving an object across a flat surface
  • align (NOT adjust/match) — for aligning two objects/edges together
  • rotate (NOT turn/spin/adjust) — for rotating an object in hand or on surface
  • tighten (NOT adjust/secure) — for fastening, tightening screws, caps, or bolts
  • fold (NOT adjust/crease) — for folding material, wire, cloth, or paper
  • tuck (NOT adjust/insert) — for tucking something inside or behind something
  • squeeze (NOT adjust/press) — for squeezing or pressing an object
  • pass from [X] to [Y] (NOT move/give/transfer) — for hand-to-hand transfers
  • gather (NOT collect) — for scooping with hands
  • wipe (NOT clean/brush) — for wiping a surface with cloth/hand
  • touch (NOT reach) — for touching an object when not picking it up
  • look at (NOT inspect) — for visually examining an object while held

  STRICT BANNED WORDS TABLE (NEVER use these words — always use the specific physical replacement):
  ❌ inspect    → use: look at, hold, pick up (describe the actual physical motion, not cognition)
  ❌ adjust     → use: slide, align, rotate, flatten, tighten, fold, tuck, squeeze (specify exact mechanical motion)
  ❌ reach      → use: pick up, hold, touch, open (describe completed action, never empty hand movement)
  ❌ manipulate → use: slide, rotate, fold, squeeze, or the exact physical action verb
  ❌ tool       → use: exact tool noun: spoon, cloth, lid, bottle, hoe, shears, screwdriver, pliers, etc.
  ❌ grab       → use: pick up (Atlas standard verb for taking/lifting objects)
  ❌ reposition → use: place, slide, align, rotate

PRINCIPLE 8 — HAND-TO-HAND PASSES (Always explicit)
  ALWAYS label passing an object from one hand to the other as a distinct action.
  ✅ "pick up bottle with right hand, pass bottle from right hand to left hand"
  ❌ "pick up bottle with right hand" (missing the pass if it happened!)
  ❌ "hold bottle with left hand" if that hand just received it — write the pass instead.
  Text clue: If segment ends with left hand having an item that right hand had before → pass happened.

PRINCIPLE 9 — VERB FORM & GRAMMAR (Strict format rules)
  • Imperative mood only: "pick up spoon with right hand" (❌ NEVER "picks up spoon", "picking up spoon", "sealing bag")
  • No articles: NEVER write "the", "a", "an" (❌ "pick up the spoon" → ✅ "pick up spoon")
  • No pronouns: NEVER write "their", "his", "her", "its" (❌ "seal their bag" → ✅ "seal bag")
  • Numbers in words: Spell out all numbers (❌ "3 knives" → ✅ "three knives")
  • No temporal/intent words: NEVER use "then", "next", "after", "before", "trying to", "wants to"
  • Always name the hand: "left hand", "right hand", or "both hands" must follow every verb-object clause.
  • No body parts other than hands: NEVER mention fingers, thumb, arm, leg (❌ "wash spoon with fingers" → ✅ "wash spoon with right hand")
  • Punctuation: Only use commas ( , ) or "and" as separators. NEVER use semicolons ( ; ) or slashes ( / ).
  • Verb-Object structure: Every verb must attach to a specific named object (❌ "seal with both hands" → ✅ "seal bag with both hands").

PRINCIPLE 10 — MINIMAL-EDIT (Do not hallucinate actions, but DO fix wrong verbs)
  BEFORE correcting, check: is the current label ALREADY valid?
  • Valid = correct verb form + correct hand + correct object + correct action count + correct verb for what's happening
  If ALL conditions are met → return UNCHANGED.
  If the VERB is wrong (e.g., "cut" when the action is "align") → ALWAYS fix the verb, even if the rest is valid.
  Do NOT add actions not in the video. Do NOT keep a wrong verb just because format looks correct.
  Action count in your label MUST match what is visible in the segment.

PRINCIPLE 11 — NO ACTION RULE
  Use "No Action" ONLY if both hands are completely idle for 5+ consecutive seconds.
  NEVER mix "No Action" with real actions in the same label.
  A task-relevant hold is NOT "No Action".

PRINCIPLE 15 — PREPARATION vs EXECUTION (Cutting tools)
  When scissors, knife, or any cutting tool is present, distinguish between:

  ALIGN (Preparation — before cutting):
    BOTH hands are touching/moving the material to position it.
    The cutting tool is held PASSIVELY while hands position the material.
    → Use: "hold scissors with right hand, align papers with both hands"
    ❌ NOT: "cut papers with scissors" (tool is not actively cutting)

  CUT (Execution — during cutting):
    The hand with the cutting tool is actively moving blades through material.
    One or both hands guide the cut.
    → Use: "cut paper with scissors in right hand"
    ❌ NOT: "align papers" (material is being cut, not positioned)

  KEY SIGNAL: Both hands moving material = ALIGN. Scissor blades moving = CUT.
  This principle applies to any cutting scenario: scissors, knife, box cutter, shears, etc.

PRINCIPLE 16 — COMPLETE DISCREPANCY OVERRIDE (Visual takes priority)
  If the input label describes an action or object that is ENTIRELY DIFFERENT from what you see in the video:
  ❌ DO NOT try to edit or adjust the wrong input label.
  ✅ Discard it completely and write the correct label from scratch based ONLY on what the hands are actually doing in the video.
  EXAMPLE: If input label is "open drawer with left hand" but video shows "pick up book with right hand", the corrected label MUST be: "pick up book with right hand".
  The video content is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH. The input label is only a candidate.

PRINCIPLE 12 — OBJECT NAME SIMPLIFICATION (Always apply this lookup)
  Strip all brand names, color prefixes, and redundant type qualifiers. Keep ONE core category noun.
  Apply this simplification table universally:

  CONTAINERS & BOTTLES:
    syrup bottle / oil bottle / juice bottle / water bottle → bottle
    plastic bottle / glass bottle / spray bottle         → bottle
    snack bag / candy bag / chip bag / food bag          → bag
    small flat packet / foil packet / seasoning sachet   → sachet
    plastic bag / shopping bag / grocery bag             → bag

  CUPS & DISHES:
    glass cup / mug / drinking cup / ceramic cup         → cup  (keep "glass" only if next to ceramic/plastic cup)
    bowl / mixing bowl / soup bowl                       → bowl
    plate / dinner plate / small plate                   → plate

  TOOLS & UTENSILS:
    metal ladle / wooden spoon / cooking spoon           → ladle / spoon (use the most specific tool name)
    garden hoe / long-handled hoe / digging tool         → hoe
    wire stripper / pliers / cutting tool                → shears / pliers (identify exactly)
    flat screwdriver / cross screwdriver                 → screwdriver

  FABRIC & TEXTILE:
    white cloth / cleaning cloth / wiping cloth          → cloth  (drop color unless 2+ cloths of different colors)
    red bag / orange bag / green bag                     → bag    (drop color unless disambiguating)

  GENERAL RULE:
    [color] + [type] + [category] → keep ONLY [category] (or [type] if it clarifies what it is)
    EXCEPTION: Keep color ONLY when 2+ visually similar objects exist simultaneously in the clip.

  ✅ "pick up bottle with right hand"         (NOT "pick up syrup bottle with right hand")
  ✅ "place bag on counter with right hand"   (NOT "place orange snack bag on counter with right hand")
  ✅ "pick up sachet with right hand"         (NOT "pick up red sachet packet with right hand")

PRINCIPLE 13 — SEQUENTIAL HAND INFERENCE (Cross-segment logic)
  Use the SEQUENCE of segments to infer which hand has the object:
  • If segment N ends with "pass [object] from right hand to left hand"
    → segment N+1 action on that object MUST use LEFT HAND.
  • If segment N ends with "place [object] with right hand"
    → right hand is now free; next pick-up can use either hand.
  Apply this logic to correct wrong hand attributions even in text-only mode.
  EXAMPLE: Seg1 = "pass bottle from right hand to left hand" → Seg2 = "place bottle on counter with LEFT hand" (NOT right hand!)

PRINCIPLE 14 — ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS (What NOT to label)
  Do NOT label environmental setup actions if the segment also contains primary task actions.
  ENVIRONMENTAL (skip if task actions exist): open door, close door, pull drawer, open lid, open fridge
  ✅ Segment has "open fridge door" + "pick up bottle" → ONLY label "pick up bottle"
  ✅ Segment is ONLY door opening (no item handling) → label "open refrigerator door with right hand"
  Rule: Atlas labels TASK ACTIONS (what is done to an item), not environment navigation.
